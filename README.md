# Introduction
I'm trying to learn the C programming language after using Python for over two years, it's my first serious attempt to learn a second language and I chose C given how much I can learn about
how languages and computers in general actually work under the hood. It is also my first time actually attempting Advent of Code, it's a fun little puzzle that I think can definitely help me 
learn C, not only that, but also teach me problem solving skills, hitting two birds with one stone. 

Every AoC solution I write in C will be posted here in this repo, along with that, I'll give my remarks on what I learned that day and any improvements I made in the table below. I'll try to 
code a solution for each day every day and do both Part 1 and Part 2, however I've got other programming projects and also lots of stuff to do in real life, so no committment that
I'll be able to do it everyday. 


## 2015
| Day  | Remarks | Complete? (Both Part 1 and Part 2) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Used the basic concepts (for loop, incremation, if-statements) Learned how file handling works in C, though was confused about the allocation thing. Found out about `strlen`. Relatively Easy| Yes
| 2 | Figured out how to dynamically allocate memory for file handling so I'm not leaving beyond bytes, also discovered `sscanf` to read lines. Took a while to figure out Part 2 but turns out I was doing it wrong with figuring out the smallest sides | Yes
